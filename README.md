## How to test:

1. Access https://pgmascarini.github.io/portfolio/. If you preffer you can download the code and execute index.html locally.
2. To test the mobile, just reduce the screen size smaller than 768px.
3. In mobile size you can see the hamburguer menu (some JavaScript was added to optimize it).
4. Once the menu is open, you click in anywhere else, it will close. If you resize the screan, it will also close. 
5. A smooth scroll was added on page scrolling.
6. The section My Skills will execute the animation only once. The first time you reach the section (JavaScript was added to make it possible).
7. All the radio buttons have been customized to look same in all browsers. 
8. All the icons was created using image sprite in other to avoid back and forth in the server (As we could not use any external library to get the icons).
9. All the focusable elements can be accessed using tab key. They will look same in all browsers.
